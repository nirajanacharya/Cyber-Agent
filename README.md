# Cyber-Agent

Cyber-Agent is an intelligent, agentic AI chatbot that I am developing as a **capstone project** as well as part of the **CyberSachet** initiative. The project focuses on cyber awareness, digital safety, and guidance for people facing online or cyber-related issues in Nepal.

This system is being built incrementally, with an emphasis on practical AI engineering concepts such as document processing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agent-based workflows.

## Project Motivation

Many individuals affected by cyber incidents are unsure about:
- whether what they are experiencing is a cyber-related issue
- what immediate steps they should take
- where to find reliable and trustworthy information

Cyber-Agent aims to serve as an accessible first point of guidance by explaining risks in simple language, suggesting appropriate actions, and pointing users toward trusted resources when necessary.

## What Cyber-Agent Does

- Provides cyber awareness and digital safety information
- Helps users understand common cyber threats and online risks
- Guides users through possible next steps when facing cyber issues
- Offers supportive responses for users under stress or confusion
- Uses retrieved information rather than generating unsupported answers

This system is designed for **informational and supportive purposes only** and does not replace legal professionals, law enforcement, or emergency services.

## Technical Overview

Cyber-Agent is built using modern AI engineering practices:

- **Document processing**: Extracting and cleaning content from PDFs and text sources
- **Chunking**: Splitting documents into retrievable units for effective search
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combining document retrieval with LLM-based responses
- **Agentic behavior**: Asking clarifying questions and selecting relevant information
- **Structured outputs**: Enforcing response schemas for consistency and safety

## Data Sources

The system works with:
- Public cyber awareness materials
- High-level legal and policy documents
- Publicly available guidance and support resources

Only non-confidential and publicly accessible data is used.

## Ethical and Safety Considerations

- The system does not provide legal judgments or emergency decisions
- Responses are informational and guidance-based
- Sensitive situations are handled with care and safety boundaries
- Users are encouraged to seek professional or official help when appropriate
