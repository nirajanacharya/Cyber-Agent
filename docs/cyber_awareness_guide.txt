CYBER AWARENESS GUIDE: COMMON THREATS AND PROTECTION

This document provides practical cyber awareness information to help protect against common online threats.

SECTION 1: PHISHING ATTACKS

What is Phishing?
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to steal credentials, personal information, or money. Attacks typically use fake emails, websites, or messages.

Common Phishing Tactics:
1. Fake Banking Sites - Criminals create fake bank websites to capture login credentials
2. Email Impersonation - Emails appearing to be from banks, government, or trusted companies
3. Urgent Action Required - "Verify account", "Confirm identity", "Update payment method"
4. Malicious Links - Links to infected websites or credentials-stealing pages
5. Attachments - Emails with infected PDF, Word, or Excel files
6. SMS/Messaging Phishing (Smishing) - Text messages asking to click links or call numbers
7. Phone Phishing (Vishing) - Phone calls impersonating banks or organizations

How to Identify Phishing:
- Check sender email address carefully (may be spoofed domain)
- Look for generic greetings ("Dear Customer" instead of your name)
- Poor grammar and spelling errors
- Urgent language creating pressure to act quickly
- Requests for passwords, credit card, or sensitive information
- Links that don't match the organization's domain
- Threatening language about account closure
- Requests to update payment information
- Misspelled URLs in links (e.g., amaz0n.com instead of amazon.com)
- Unable to verify organization's contact information

Protection Against Phishing:
1. Verify sender identity independently (call official number)
2. Don't click links in emails - go directly to official website
3. Check website SSL certificate (look for lock icon)
4. Use strong, unique passwords for each account
5. Enable two-factor authentication
6. Keep browser and security software updated
7. Use email filters and spam detection
8. Report phishing emails to organization and authorities
9. Be suspicious of unexpected emails requesting information
10. Never share passwords, PIN, or OTP with anyone

SECTION 2: MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE

What is Malware?
Malware is malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or compromise your system, data, or privacy. Types include viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware.

Types of Malware:
1. Viruses - Attach to programs and spread when executed
2. Worms - Self-replicating programs that spread without user action
3. Trojans - Disguised as legitimate programs but contain harmful code
4. Ransomware - Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption key
5. Spyware - Monitors and steals personal information
6. Adware - Forces unwanted advertisements and redirects browsing
7. Keyloggers - Records keyboard inputs to steal passwords and data
8. Rootkits - Provides attacker administrative access to system
9. Botnets - Infected computers controlled remotely by attackers
10. Cryptominers - Uses system resources to mine cryptocurrency

Ransomware Special Threat:
- Locks or encrypts all files on infected system
- Attacker demands payment for decryption key
- Often threatens to publish stolen data if payment not made
- Can spread to connected networks and backup systems
- Business can lose critical data and operations

How Systems Get Infected:
- Opening infected email attachments
- Clicking malicious links in emails or websites
- Downloading software from untrusted sources
- Using infected USB drives or external storage
- Visiting compromised websites
- Outdated software with known vulnerabilities
- Poor security practices and weak passwords

Protection Against Malware:
1. Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware software
2. Keep Windows and Mac operating systems updated
3. Update all software and applications regularly
4. Use firewall on computers and networks
5. Download software only from official sources
6. Don't open suspicious email attachments
7. Be cautious of unexpected downloads
8. Don't enable macros in documents unless necessary
9. Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
10. Regular backups on separate storage (not connected to network)
11. Educate users about malware risks

If Infected:
1. Disconnect from network immediately
2. Shut down computer to prevent spread
3. Use secure device to report to cybersecurity professional
4. Do not pay ransom (no guarantee of decryption)
5. Contact law enforcement
6. Restore from clean backup if available
7. Change all passwords from secure device
8. Monitor accounts for fraudulent activity

SECTION 3: WEAK PASSWORDS AND CREDENTIAL THEFT

Password Risks:

- Default passwords on devices are well-known to attackers

Creating Strong Passwords:
- Minimum 12-16 characters (longer is better)
- Mix of uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase (a-z), numbers (0-9), symbols (!@#$%)
- Avoid personal information (names, birthdays, phone numbers)
- Avoid dictionary words and common phrases
- Don't use keyboard patterns (qwerty, 12345)
- Make it random and memorable only to you
- Change passwords when account is compromised
- Don't reuse old passwords

Password Management:
1. Use password manager to generate and store strong passwords
2. Enable two-factor authentication when available
3. Don't share passwords with anyone

- P@ss#2024Nepal!Cyber
- Blue$Tiger*42Ocean@Lab
- Coffee!Rain#2024Secure9

SECTION 4: PUBLIC WI-FI SECURITY

2. Use VPN to encrypt all traffic
3. Avoid sensitive transactions (banking, passwords) on public Wi-Fi
4. Turn off automatic connection to known networks
5. Disable file sharing and AirDrop on your device
6. Use HTTPS websites only (look for lock icon)
